My workfiles for Python for Everybody Specialization (University of Michigan via Coursera)

Hi. I hope you could find something useful from these files that I uploaded. Please feel free to use this as a reference for your learning. Just don't just copy and paste as if it was yours. Study the materials well as I studied those as well

Thanks
